The Discord Email Bot allows users to send, save, and manage emails directly from Discord.
You can send casual messages in Discord, and the bot will deliver them as professional emails — automatically formatted and polished.

It also supports file attachments in emails.
You can save email addresses as aliases (nicknames), so next time you can send emails faster without typing full addresses again.
to save emails == save Email
to remove emails == remove Email
